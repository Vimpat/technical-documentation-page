                <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation</p>
                <p>Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open source software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.</p>

                <p>There were 5 primary goals in the cration of the Java language</p>
                <p>Also, you should have some general understanding of the principles of OOP</p>

                    <h1>Java vs C++</h1>
                </header>
                <p>Learning C++ and Java will give you a basic understanding of programming. So anyone who is new to programming is usually learn either or both of these two languages before going to other languages and technologies. This is the reason why schools and colleges that teach programming have C++ and/or Java as necessary subjects so that the students can get a good idea of what is C programming language.</p>
                <p>There are several differences between C++ and Java, ranging from Pointers (as Java does not support them) to Thread support (as c++ doesn't have built-in support for it)</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
                <header>
                    <h1>Hello world</h1>
                </header>
                <p>The traditional Hello world program can be written in Java as:</p>
                <code>public class HelloWorldApp {</code>
                <br>
                <code>  public static void main(String[] args) {</code>
                <br>
                <code>      System.out.println("Hello world!");</code>
                <br>
                <code>  }</code>
                <br>
                <code>}</code>
                <br>
                <p>All source files must be named after the public class they contain, appending the suffix .java, for example, HelloWorldApp.java. It must first be compiled into bytecode, using a Java compiler, producing a file with the .class suffix (HelloWorldApp.class, in this case). Only then can it be executed or launched. The Java source file may only contain one public class, but it can contain multiple classes with a non-public access modifier and any number of public inner classes. When the source file contains multiple classes, it is necessary to make one class (introduced by the class keyword) public (preceded by the public keyword) and name the source file with that public class name.</p>
